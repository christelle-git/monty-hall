* The goal is to determine the best strategy between keep or change the second choice.


* This program runs several simulations of the game, from 100 to 100000, and depicts the results by showing the number of winning parties with respect to the adopted strategy, either keep or change the original choice.

  => It appears that the best strategy is to change the second choice.
